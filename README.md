# Guess the Number (Python)

A simple console-based guessing game written in Python.

---

## Project Overview
This project was created as a practice exercise to strengthen basic Python skills.  
The program generates a random number and asks the user to guess it within a limited number of attempts.

---

## Features
- Random number generation
- Difficulty levels that affect the number of attempts
- User input handling
- Game loop with attempt counter
- Hints for each guess (too low / too high)

---

## Technologies
- Python 3
- Python standard library (`random`)

---

## How the Game Works
1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
2. The user chooses a difficulty level (easy, medium, hard).
3. The user enters guesses until the number is guessed or attempts run out.
4. The program provides feedback after each guess.

## How to Run
1. Install Python 3 if it is not installed.
2. Run the script from the terminal:
```bash
python main.py
